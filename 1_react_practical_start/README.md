# React Starter Course

This project demonstrates the use of React by building a simple website for realestate company. It simply displays a house and its details such as the `name`, `price`, `address`, `a brief details`.

It has a feature for contact through a contact button. A contact form is displayed once this button is clicked.

## Structure of the website
The structure of the system is as follows;
* A header component
* Search Result
* Featured House

The header component contains the logo and motto of the company. Immediately below this header is a search section that allows one to search for houses by location. The featured area is withdrawn to display the list of houses in a list format. Each item can be clicked to show full details.
